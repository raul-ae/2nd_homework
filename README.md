# 2nd_homework
Responsive Portfolio

For this homework I created 4 independent HTML Files:
1st - index.HTML - with a welcome picture
2nd - about.html - with my professionl BIO
3rd - Portfolio - with placeholders for my future projects
4th - contact - with a dummy contact form 

all HTML files have been validated with: https://validator.w3.org/ evidence included in repository assets/validation evidence/

<!-- Index -->
Navbars are consitent in the 4 pages, using template from bootstrap, active page is highlighted in navigtion bar so the user knows where he is.

in Main page (index.html) he main picture is responsive to 3 different screen size trying to emphasize the main part of the picture and the text.

footer is consistent in the four pages with working links to socialmedia accounts, icons are extracted from Font Awesome. some issues were encountered when the code was commited to github, apparently the HTML was not able to find the CSS reference, so I copied that file in mycss file and it worked.

<!-- about -->
A section contains a picture and text, the deign is responsive so text adapts to page interacting with the picture for an easier reading experience

<!-- portfolio -->
As there is no content to upload yet to the portfolio, cards from bootstrap are used as place holders for future links

<!-- contact -->
a form from bootstrap is used although the form is not functional as there is no backend added yet

<!-- Styles -->
a CSS file (mystyle.css) includes the styles for the 4 HTML's using classes and in some cases overwriting the frmating from CSS to adapt colors.

<!-- Main learnings -->
I learnt that if it works in local server does not necessarily work when it is commited to Github, I had to spend soe thing fixing issues on images and styles that were not relfected when commited, Inspect and console helped  lot

Also I learnt that it is super slow to try to program and design at the same time, I will try to desing first and them code for future projects.
